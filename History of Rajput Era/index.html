King used to make any one of his sons as the 'Yuvraj' or his successor who later on became the king. There are instances which show that people or courtiers used to elect or select the King of their choice. Like King Yashaskar of Kashmir was chosen by a committee of Brahmins. Ministers were of two types at that time : (1) Amatya (ministers) (2) Secretaries. Amatya's job was to negotiate and do politics and the Secretaries' job was to fight and make peace. The final decision on every policy was taken by the King. At that time the bureaucrats of the regime were holding positions like Maha Pratihar and Dandnayak. The head of the town council was called the mayor (Nagarpati).
